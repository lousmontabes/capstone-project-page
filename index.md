# Geolocalisation of DNA chimpanzee samples using machine learning
*Paula Esteller, David Martin and Lluis Montabes*

## 1. Background
As humans we have always been fascinated by our closest related species, the chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*). At the same time, human activities have led to a drastic decline in the population size of this species, mainly caused by the illegal wildlife trade, habitat destruction, poaching for local consumption and human linked disease outbreaks, among many others. In this regard, genetic information could be useful to infer the populations of origin of confiscated individuals from illegal trade, detect poaching hotspots, and guide repatriation planning. Taking advantage of the most complete chimpanzee genetic map ever generated, here we implement a machine-learning geolocalisation approach, assessing its precision and robustness in determining the origin of confiscated chimpanzees.

## 2. Objectives
To take advantage of an extensive dataset on genomic variation in georeferenced chimpanzees to develop a machine-learning-based tool for the geolocation of chimpanzee samples which can be further implemented in other species.

## 3. Overview of the data
The dataset used for this project was retrieved from [Fontsere et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666979X22000623) and consists of a catalog of genomic diversity obtained by capturing chromosome 21 from 828 non-invasively collected samples at 48 sampling sites across Africa.

#### Genomic data

This dataset contains the genomic information along chromosome 21 derived from fecal samples. Due to the nature of non-invasive samples (feces and hair) retrieving good quality genomic information is challenging. For each position in the chromosome, two nucleotides (A, T, C or G) are present, each of which deriving from one of the parents. Genomic data is mapped and referenced to the genomic information of the so-called reference genome. A reference genome is a sequence of DNA used as the reference or gold-standard of genomic information of a certain species. These reference genomes only contain one copy of each chromosome (as opposed to the two copies a biological sample would have) and so, only one nucleotide is chosen to be the representative for each position (eg. position 1 is A, position 2 is T, position 3 is G, position 4 is Tâ€¦). The genomic information of the chimpanzee sample is stored in relation to the one in the reference. To simplify, in our dataset if the sample has the same information as the one in the reference genome, it is denoted with a *0*, if it has one of the two nucleotides like the one in the reference and the other is different, it would be denoted with a *1*. Finally, if the two nucleotides are different from the one in the reference, this position would be denoted with a *2* in our dataset. Finally, positions for which no genomic information is available are denoted with a *9*. Since the data used in this project comes from feces, it is low quality, and so for many samples and positions there will not be genomic information, and so the value will be *9*. Each of these samples is georeferenced, which means that the exact coordinates of the place of collection of the feces are known. Because of this, for each sample, we have information about its GPS coordinates, sampling site, country or origin, and also the chimpanzee subspecies it belongs.

The following image summarises how genomic data is interpreted and has been stored in this project.

### More information

To know more about what it means to work with fecal samples, please have a look at the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_LzqCeFoI&t=1457s) (in Catalan). It explains the methodology and main aim of geoposition (in the context of Gorillas instead of Chimpanzees) and it is less than 4 minutes-long.

## 4. Data processing and quality control

### 4.1. Data filtering

In order for the data to be suitable for our purposes, it had to be first pre-processed. First, all non-informative positions were removed (ie. those containing the same genotype in all samples or with all NAs). After having filtered out non-informative positions, there were still some positions and samples which remained non-informative. These were positions with a high number of NA for most samples and also samples which had a high number of NA for most positions. Since we were facing a problem of high degree of missing values, it was important to consider those samples and positions that did not add a lot of information for the modelling. 

Because of that, and after leveraging the number of samples and positions that would result from this filtering, we ended up choosing to remove positions (columns in the dataframe) with more than 80% missingness (defined as those that did not have information for 80% or more of the samples, *rows*). We also filtered out the samples (rows in the dataframe) with more than 70% missingness (with NaN for 70% of their positions, *columns*).

In order for our data to be suitable for our purposes, we had to first pre-process it to fit our needs. There were several obstacles to overcome:

The following image summarises the process by with the data was filtered.

</p>

### 4.2. Imputation of missing values

After the initial filtering of the data, there were some cells values that remained missing and so as not to skew the modelling in any way, we chose to impute these cells with the global mean value.

The following figure shows the distribution of mean values per sample. The mean value of around 0.12 was imputed in all missing values.

### 4.3. Data visualisation
Since the goal of this project is to being able to classify variable like subspecies and sampling site, we decided to inspect this data to make sure that the proportion of the samples remains unaltered after filtering. In the following figures we can see the number of samples included in the dataset after filtering that belong to each subspecies and also stratified by sampling site.

### 4.4. Quality control by means of PC analysis
We performed Principal Component analysis (PCA) in order to check the impact that the filtering applied to the data could have had in our samples. If the analysis had been so stringent so as to remove the biological meaning of our data, samples should not cluster by subspecies. PC analysis was perfomed on all filtered data and then plotted and coloured according on different variables: subspecies and sampling site.

The four subspecies followed the clustering pattern expected so that all subspecies could be separated. This indicated that the filtering we perfomed in the dataset did not have a negative impact in the data, since a biological signal can still be retrieved. 

PCA coloured by sampling site

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68989675/176558138-44254dd9-b812-452c-995c-83e693c6730d.png" width="500"/> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68989675/176558172-f43ca687-1705-48f7-a765-8f4307254916.png" width="500"/> 

Note that only PC1 *vs* PC2 and PC5 *vs* PC6 were shown. No substructure is seen in the first components of the PC if we plot the PCA by sampling site. This is also to be expected, since PCA captures common variation in the first components and so we expect private positions to be driving sampling site substructure. As such, we could only expect the PC to start distinguishing sampling sites in bigger PCs. This can be seen if we plot the PC5 *vs* PC6. 

## 5. Modelling
We used our data to train supervised models on three different variables: the **subspecies** of the chimpanzee sample, the **sampling site** where the sample was obtained and the **approximate coordinated** of the origin of the sample. For the first two variables, a classifier was modelled and for the last variable, regressors were used.

For most of the models, the data was divided into two subsets: a training set (80% of the data, n = 276 samples) and a test set (20% of the data, n = 70 samples).

### 5.1. Classification of subspecies

Considering the fact that we are working with genetic data of chimpanzees distributed accross a very large geographical range encompassing most of west and central Africa, the most obvious distinction and a first approximation we can hope to find in our data is the **subspecies** of chimpanzee the DNA corresponds to.

We can identify four distinct subspecies:
- Western chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes verus*)
- Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes ellioti*)
- Central chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes troglodytes*)
- Eastern chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii*)

We used the following models in this prediction:

1. Random Forest
2. Nearest Neighbor
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Naive Bayes

The code used in this section can be found in *Notebooks/Geolocalisation - Notebook 2.1. Modelling genomic data - SUBSPECIES.ipynb*

The modelling for this data was very straightforward and in all cases we made use of the default parameters for each model. This is because early on we found that we were obtaining very good results without the need to adjust parameters.

The results of predicting at subspecies level were very satisfactory, achieving perfect classifications accross three out of the four classifiers used. The following table summarises the performace of the different models tested for the classifications of subspecies.

|Classifier  | F1-score  | Accuracy |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Random Forest  | 1  | 1  |
|Nearest Neighbor | 1  | 1  |   
|Support Vector Machine | 1  | 1  |   
|Categorical Naive Bayes |  0.89 | 0.5  |  

<sup>'F1-score' corresponds to F1-score (micro) and 'Accuracy' correponds to balanced accuracy.</sup>

We can see that **Categorical Naive Bayes** is the only model that didn't achieve accuracy of 1.

The following figures show the confusion matrices of each model's predictions of subspecies of the test set.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7366498/176046757-a310e948-c443-4ef2-9341-ad522b5a3995.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7366498/176046763-045e8d5f-e5ea-4f40-9a1d-c475c71f6d4b.png)

In this case, it can be observed that **Categorical Naive Bayes** is not able to correctly predict the subspecies of the samples which belong to either the Central or Nigeria-Cameroon subspecies.

**Conclusion:** As anticipated by the PC analysis, the sample's subspecies can be easily predicted using a variety of classifiers. In our case, it was a proof that the biological meaning of the data was not lost after filtering and that different models can be used for prediction in our data.

### 5.2. Classification of sampling site

After having obtained good results at the subspecies level, we then proceeded to classify our samples at a higher resolution: predicting the sampling site the sample was obtained from. We had a total of 36 named sampling sites that were used as labels. Also, and based on the performance of the different classifiers for modelling subspecies, the classifiers that were evaluated were restricted to:

1. Random Forest
2. Nearest Neighbor
3. Support Vector Machine

The code used in this section can be found in *Notebooks/Geolocalisation - Notebook 2.2. Modelling genomic data - SAMPLINGSITE.ipynb*

As anticipated, predicting sampling site was more complex than predicting each sample subspecies and so for that we performed a different strategy. First we fit each classifier using default parameters and then optimised the parameters for each classifier. 

However, given the nature of this project (ie. the dataset of study contains a relatively low number of samples), when dividing the whole dataset into train and test sets, the number of instance in each of the groups became even smaller. Because of this, the power to train a classifier that was able to accurately predict the location of a particular sample was also reduced. As such, we decided to implement the **leave-one-out cross-validation** approach, as it allows for each sample to be used as a test set while the remaining samples remain in the training set. This method is less biased and tends to not overesetimate perfomance of the model eventhough it is computationally expensive. In our case, the implemented this approach with the optimised parameters of each classifier.

|Classifier  | F1-score (def)| Accuracy (def) | F1-score (opt)| Accuracy (opt) |F1-score (loo)| Accuracy (loo) |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Random Forest  | 0.64  | 0.56  | 0.61  | 0.56  |0.66  | 0.48  |
|Nearest Neighbor | 0.47  | 0.47  |   0.61  | 0.59  |0.70  | 0.58 |
|Support Vector Machine | 0.80  | 0.74  |   0.80  | 0.74  |0.83  | 0.72  |

<sup>'F1-score' corresponds to F1-score (micro) and 'Accuracy' correponds to balanced accuracy. 'def', 'opt' and 'loo' denote default, optimised and leave-one-out cross-validation with optimised parameters, respectively.</sup>

The classifier based on **Support Vector Machine** shows the highest accuracy and f1-scores, specially when implemented with the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. As such, we encourage to use this classifier for geolocalising chimpanzee samples with considerably high accuracy.

**Conclusion:** As it was to be expected, accurately predicting the sampling site of a chimpanzee sample is more complex than assessing its subspecies. Here we have presented a comparative approach of different classifiers to do so. We consitently saw that when parameters were optimised for the different classifiers, although the F1-scores and accuracy were only slighlty improving and the new predicted sites were in most cases still incorrect, they were located closer to the true sampling site. This makes us believe that assessing the accuracy of the classifiers by means of calculating the distance (eg. in kilometers) from the true origin should prove to be a more appropiate way to evaluate the performance of the different models. Regadless of the metric used to assess this, we saw that the classifier based on **support vector machine** shows the highest F1-scores and accuracy of the three models, and so we encourage to use this classifier for geolocalising chimpanzee samples with considerably high accuracy.

### 5.3. Geographic prediction

As we had the information regarding the coordinates of each sample, we used it to create regression models and predict the relative area where a sample was taken from. We used the following models:
1. Linear Regression
2. K Nearest Neighbors Regression

#### Linear Regression
We first used a simple Linear Regression model to test if we could indeed predict the coordinates of a sample given our data.
We obtained a mean error of 1.602, meaning that our predicted coordinates were, in average, around 1.602 degrees off, or approximately 178 kilometers.

The R2 score of our model was 0.976, indicating a high level of codetermination between our predictors and our regression line.

#### K Nearest Neighbors Regression
Given that we obtained satisfactory results from a simple Linear Regression, we wanted to test another model to see if these results were consistent. To this end, we chose to test using K-Nearest Neighbors Regression.

This model yielded slightly better results than the Linear Regression model; the mean error in prediction ranged from 1.3 to 1.315 depending on the parameters we trained the model with - considerably better than the error obtained from LR. Our R2 score ranged between 0.973 and 0.978, indicating, again, a high level of codetermination.

depending on the parameters it gives a mean error in prediction between 1.30 and 1.315 depending on the algorithm and a r2-score between 0.973 and 0.978.

**Conclusion:**  AÃ‘ADIR CONCLUSION DE ESTA PARTE

## 6. Limitations of the study and future advances
+ The main **limitation** of this study is the **dataset** itself. As such, the sites that are not represented in the training dataset cannot be used for prediction. Because of this, it could be required that the **training *vs* test** were **equality represented** and consider removing sampling sites with a small number of samples.
+ Expand the reference dataset by adding **lower quality** samples in order to assess the performance of the classifiers.
+ Assess **alternative imputation methods** which are biologically relevant, eg. linkage disequilibrium.
+ **Develop a metric** to assess the perfomance of the predictors based on distance to true origin rather than success in prediction.
+ **Stratify the perfomance metrics according to subspecies** in order to account for differences in the distribution ranges of each subspecies.
+ Expand this methodology to geolocalise *other species* (eg. bonobos, gorillas, orangutans).

## 7. Conclusions
We have shown that it is possible to apply supervised machine-learning tools for the identification and geolocalisation of genomic data. In particular, we show that:
+ A variety of classifiers can be used to accurately assign the subspecies of a chimpanzee using genomic information.
+ Using a support-vector-machine-based classifier is a good alternative to geolocalise chimpanzee samples with considerably high accuracy (~0.8 f1-score).
+ ULTIMA CONCLUSION DE REGRESORES
